Bluetooth
=========
Bluetooth is a standard set of binary protocols for short-range wireless communication between devices.
Bluetooth "Classic" (BR/EDR) supports speeds up to about 24Mbps. Bluetooth 4.0 introduces a low energy mode
that operates at 1Mbps.
This mode allows devices to leave their transmitters off most of the time.
As a result this mode is know as "Low Energy". You will also see it referred to as "Bluetooth Smart", BLE,
or just LE.
The BLE functionality is dominated by key/value pairs to create the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT).

BLE defines multiple roles that devices can play:
- The Broadcaster (beacon) is a transmitter only application.
- The Observer (scanner) is for receiver only applications.
- Devices acting in the Peripheral role can receive connections.
- Devices acting in the Central role can connect to Peripheral devices.

BlueZ
=====
BlueZ is a Bluetooth stack for Linux family of operating systems. Support for BlueZ can be found in many Linux
distributions available.

The highest level of API on BlueZ is the DBus API which can be daunting to users unfamiliar with such APIs.
Bluezero offers users a more gentle learning curve to using Bluetooth functionality on Linux.

Bluezero API Complexity
=======================
This section gives guidelines about the complexity of different APIs. We will use the terms Level 1, 10 and 100.
A new user would start at level 1 as this should offer the least friction. If at a later stage a greater level
of control is needed then the user can progress on to the other levels. As the user becomes more experienced they
may not need Bluezero and use BlueZ on its own. The numbers for the API levels represent the steps in code and
knowledge required with each step.

Level 1
-------
- At this level the interface will be pythonic
- No knowledge of Bluetooth, DBus and event loops will be assumed.
- For something to exist at this level there will need to be a public Bluetooth Profile in existence so that users donâ€™t need to enter UUIDs etc.
- This might be specific hardware such as the BBC micro:bit or it could be more generalised hardware such as Heart Rate Monitors.

Level 10
--------
- At this level the interface is still pythonic
- Will assume some knowledge of Bluetooth such as UUIDs, services and characteristics
- It will not make reference to DBus or event loops.

Level 100
---------
- At this level the interface is expecting the user to know Bluetooth, DBus and event loops.
- DBus function names are not Pythonic but will be exposed at the level.
- This level will be very specific to the Linux kernel and so will be difficult to port this to other operating systems that do not have the Bluez Daemon running.
- The previous more abstracted levels of API should be easier to move to any hardware.
